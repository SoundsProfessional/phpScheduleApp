<h2>Further Development of This Project</h2>
<p>There is no mechanism to enforce the 'notice' that the biz sets. This would be implemented mostly in SQL and is probably only 10 lines of code all together</p>
<p>There is no validation for when a user creates a redundant account, it will just change that username's association to a biz (unless its a biz) and password</p>
<p>We should collect email addresses, so that it is possible to verify a user and let them recover their account in the future. Currently there is just no way to do it with confidence.</p>
<p>The CSS is absolute garbage, it can be 1/10th as long as it currently is.</p>

<h3><small><small><small><small>the rest of this is old README, for the next developer to look at and get the hang of my thinking.<br/></small></small></small></small>Design Changes</h3>
<p>Just as the notion of having a 'request off' functionality was redundant and pointless, requesting and displaying a projected requirement as anticipated by the MGR was silly and useless. This program should work just like a magic piece of paper and not have a bunch of functions that get in the way of its usefulness.</p>
<p>So that's two big page things that we had planned which I am no longer planning to do. Depending on what James thinks represents a 'page' we might be coming up short. So getting the request message thing working would be cool.</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>cross linkages in the calendars seem okay. Functionality to set availability works, to get a list of available employees, to select their checkboxes and add them to the schedule. Default works.</p>
<p>Creating a user with the same name as an existing user will screw everything up. </p>
<p>There is some 'helpful' output in the header and footer, don't let it freak you out.</p>

There are simple diagrams in the /documentation/ folder, also the MOST RECENT sql DDL language is in there.<br/><br/>
