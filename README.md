<p>I have made numerous changes to the database per our discussion.</p>
<p>makeMonth and makeWeek have been eliminated. There is one calendar creator that takes an arg "week" to make a week, otherwise it makes a month.</p>
<p>Examine the cellCreators file, all database query and acquisition happens in them.</p>
<p>form submissions should happen in the interface pages, and they'll route to the indexE.php</p>
<p>Examine the indexE.php file. It catches all of the POST for employee functions, that it where database submission happens.</p>
<p>The class diagram has been updated, it is attached to this document</p>
