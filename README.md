<h3>Design Changes</h3>
<p>Just as the notion of having a 'request off' functionality was redundant and pointless, requesting and displaying a projected requirement as anticipated by the MGR was silly and useless. This program should work just like a magic piece of paper and not have a bunch of functions that get in the way of its usefulness.</p>
<p>So that's two big page things that we had planned which I am no longer planning to do. Depending on what James thinks represents a 'page' we might be coming up short. So getting the request message thing working would be cool.</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>cross linkages in the calendars seem okay. Functionality to set availability works, to get a list of available employees, to select their checkboxes and add them to the schedule. Default works.</p>
<p>Creating a user with the same name as an existing user will screw everything up. </p>
<p>There is some 'helpful' output in the header and footer, don't let it freak you out.</p>
<br>

<h3>STUFF TO DO:</h3>
<ul><li>
Pull the new repository!
</li>SQL work -- YES YOU MUST DO THIS OR NOTHING WILL WORK
<ul><li>
Locate the test.sql (its in /documentation/ of this project) <br/>
</li><li>
import the file to your instance of the database. You will have to delete whatever is in your 'test' database and all the schema
</li>
</ul>

<li>
Get logging in functionality working 
</li><li>
The the request process needs everything. requestQue needs a page, a databse construct, and a a page in makeRequest
</li>

</ul></li></ul>
